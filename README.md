### Hello There!

I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript Developer learning the ropes of web development. 

What I'm currently learning:
  -  VueJS
  -  Leveling up my vanilla CSS
  -  React Native & mobile development 
  -  C#.Net Development
I have a long way to go and hope to share knowledge with other developers! My goal this year is to write a blog post, look out internet!
