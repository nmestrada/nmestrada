### Hello There! 🐝

I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript Developer learning the ropes of web development. 

What I currently working on is learning:
  -  Vue.JS
  -  Leveling up my vanilla CSS
  -  React Native & mobile development 
  
I have a long way to go and hope to share knowledge with other developers! My goal this year is to write a blog post, look out internet!
